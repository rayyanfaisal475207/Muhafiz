# ============================================================
# XAGG — cross-case aggregate queries (Phase 5.4).
#
# Deliberately NOT a general text-to-SQL/Cypher system — mirrors
# sql_extractor.py's scoped, template-based approach rather than
# inventing a new paradigm. Two canned aggregate families, selected by a
# simple keyword match on the query:
#   - relational: group Case rows (police_station / investigation_status /
#     crime_category) via the existing gateway.get_cases() — no new
#     DataGateway surface needed.
#   - graph: count how many distinct cases each Vehicle/Person node
#     touches via BELONGS_TO_CASE, for "top recurring X across cases"
#     questions — one Cypher query via age_client.execute_cypher.
# Every result is inherently cross-case (that's the point of XAGG), so
# the caller labels it as a cross-case finding same as XGRAPH.
